# Watts-Strogatz Model

This repository contains an implementation of the Watts-Strogatz model, which is a random graph generation model used to study small-world networks. The model was proposed by Duncan J. Watts and Steven H. Strogatz in their paper titled "Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks" published in 1998.

## Description

The Watts-Strogatz model starts with a regular lattice network and then rewires some of the edges randomly. This random rewiring introduces randomness into the network while preserving the overall regularity of the lattice structure. The model allows us to generate networks with high local clustering (like regular lattices) and short average path lengths (like random networks).

This repository provides a Python implementation of the Watts-Strogatz model. It includes functions to generate a Watts-Strogatz graph, calculate its clustering coefficient and average path length, and visualize the graph
